    <h2>Indulge into the best chocolate bars</h2>
    <p>If you are a chocolate-peanut butter fan, these no-bake peanut butter chex bars are for you. Great textures and flavors with a subtle pop of salt, they taste great with a glass of milk.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <strong>
        <li>3/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>6 cups crispy rice cereal squares, such as Chex</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/3 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        </strong>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>Gather all ingredients. Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with foil and lightly coat with nonstick cooking spray</p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Combine honey and sugar in a 4-to 6-quart Dutch oven. Heat over medium heat just until the mixture begins to boil, stirring frequently. Stir in 1 1/4 cups peanut butter and salt until fully combined.</p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>Add cereal to the pot and stir until evenly coated.</p>
    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>Transfer mixture to the prepared pan, spreading and packing in an even layer. Set aside to cool.</p>
    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <p>Meanwhile, combine chocolate chips, 1/3 cup peanut butter, and butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until fully melted,1 to 1 1/2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds. </p>
    <h2>Step 6</h2>
    <p>Pour chocolate mixture over the bars, spreading evenly. Chill bars until topping is set, 1 hour.</p>
    <h2>Step 7</h2>
    <p>Use foil to remove bars from the pan before cutting and serving. Store at room temperature for up to 5 days.</p>
