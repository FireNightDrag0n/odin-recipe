    <h2>Hawaiian Macaroni Salad</h2>
    <p>I Chef John's Hawaiian macaroni salad may be the simplest version of mac salad ever, but it is also the one that always gets finished first and gets complimented the most. And here, the simplicity is the secretâ€”when you are at a cookout, looking at a full table of spicy, flavorful, rich barbecued meats, this uncomplicated salad is exactly what you will want on the side.

</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
       <strong>
        <li>1/3 cup finely diced red onion (optional)</li>
        <li>2 2/3 cups mayonnaise, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 small carrots, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>1 pound elbow macaroni

</li>
        </strong>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>If using red onion, place onion in a bowl with enough cold water to cover. Set aside to soak for 20 minutes; drain.</p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Meanwhile, stir mayonnaise, cider vinegar, sugar, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Stir in red onion immediately after draining. Stir in grated carrot; set aside.</p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a rolling boil, and boil elbow macaroni until tender with a bite, about 5 minutes, or according to package directions. Pour into a strainer set in the sink. Run cold water over pasta until pasta is cooled to room temperature, about 30 seconds. Drain in the strainer for about 20 seconds.</p>
    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>Pour macaroni into the bowl with dressing and mix well. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover salad with a sheet of plastic directly touching the surface, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours and preferably overnight. </p>
    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <p>TRemove salad from refrigerator and stir thoroughly. Adjust texture by stirring in a spoonful of mayonnaise, and about 1/4 cup water. Stir again, and add more mayonnaise and/or water as needed. Taste for salt and adjust if needed. </p>
